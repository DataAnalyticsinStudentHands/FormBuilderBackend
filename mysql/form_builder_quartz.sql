Simply put, I love to learn; being introduced to new ideas and handling new texts is intellectually invigorating and the idea of being able to use the Smithsonian’s vast resources to compile a work of original research is thrilling to me. \nAs for my career goals, I have become increasingly interested in graduate school over the past six months. Because I am only a sophomore, a program like this for the summer before my junior year would have a profound impact on my career path, because it would give me the opportunity to dive head-first into an intensive research project in one of the best locations in the country.

It was my first time visiting a Middle Eastern country and a region of instability and high conflict. This trip made me realize there are more cities in Israel than Jerusalem; these include Netanya, Nazareth, Jericho, and Tiberias. While Israel is a deeply religious and historical country, it has many hidden jewels, such as its extensive outdoor activities. I noted this while I hiked, for the first time, down a cliff in the northern part of the country and swam in the Dead Sea. Through this trip, I appreciated the fact there will always be more than meets the eye; whether it’s a place, person or situation. However it wasn’t until the Israeli-Gaza conflict broke out, a few weeks after departing Israel, that I noticed my point of view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had changed. Visiting Israel provided me with insight that cannot be found in books or through a Google search. By interacting and observing Israelis and Palestinians in their everyday lifestyle, I gained newfound perspective on the centuries old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\nRewinding five years back, to the summer of 2009, I was part of a 30-student cohort that traveled to Italy, Vatican City, France, Austria and Switzerland with People to People; an organization that promotes peace, understanding and tolerance of other cultures by encouraging American students to travel and study abroad. I had never boarded a plane or stayed away from home for more than a weekend. By the end of the trip, I had not only visited each country’s major attractions but I was more outspoken and assertive person. I also developed an appreciation for Renaissance art and architecture after visiting museum like the Louvre. Having lived in a town on the Texas-Mexico border, I did not grow up with the diversity level Houston is known for. Thus, the biggest impact this trip had on my 14-year self was empathy for other cultures. I realize our similarities, as people, truly outweigh the differences.\n\nBoth of the study abroad trips I have taken me to the other side of the ‘pond’, the Atlantic Ocean. They have provided me with experiences that have shaped my opinions and the person I became. Unlike most of my peers, I have never visited another state in America. It was until October of last year that I travelled outside Texas but within the continental U.S. I went to North Carolina and was shocked at slight but significant difference between the two states. This internship will allow me further discover and experience the different regional cultures in the United States as well as gain knowledge in a topic.'),

While Israel is a deeply religious and historical country, it has many hidden jewels, such as its extensive outdoor activities. I noted this while I hiked, for the first time, down a cliff in the northern part of the country and swam in the Dead Sea. Through this trip, I appreciated the fact there will always be more than meets the eye; whether it’s a place, person or situation. However it wasn’t until the Israeli-Gaza conflict broke out, a few weeks after departing Israel, that I noticed my point of view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict had changed. Visiting Israel provided me with insight that cannot be found in books or through a Google search. By interacting and observing Israelis and Palestinians in their everyday lifestyle, I gained newfound perspective on the centuries old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\nRewinding five years back, to the summer of 2009, I was part of a 30-student cohort that traveled to Italy, Vatican City, France, Austria and Switzerland with People to People; an organization that promotes peace, understanding and tolerance of other cultures by encouraging American students to travel and study abroad. I had never boarded a plane or stayed away from home for more than a weekend. By the end of the trip, I had not only visited each country’s major attractions but I was more outspoken and assertive person. I also developed an appreciation for Renaissance art and architecture after visiting museum like the Louvre. Having lived in a town on the Texas-Mexico border, I did not grow up with the diversity level Houston is known for. Thus, the biggest impact this trip had on my 14-year self was empathy for other cultures. I realize our similarities, as people, truly outweigh the differences.\n\nBoth of the study abroad trips I have taken me to the other side of the ‘pond’, the Atlantic Ocean. They have provided me with experiences that have shaped my opinions and the person I became. Unlike most of my peers, I have never visited another state in America. It was until October of last year that I travelled outside Texas but within the continental U.S. I went to North Carolina and was shocked at slight but significant difference between the two states. This internship will allow me further discover and experience the different regional cultures in the United States as well as gain knowledge in a topic.'),
